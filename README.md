(QUICK ADVERTISEMENT FOR MYSELF https://andreijaycreativecoding.com/ this is my website, there is a pay pal button on here, if you have a fun time with the software i make and can afford to send me a donation it is super appreciated, the more donations i recieve means the more time i can spend working on crazy awesome open source software)

OK! so installing from these files here on the github are kind of only for folks reasonably well versed in navigating openFrameworks already!  I can't really help anyone out anymore with this sort of thing as the volume of requests has greatly outpaced the amount of time I can afford to spend on that! But for everyone who has no idea what the heck an open frame work is don't worry I jurry rigged a reasonable solution for yalls!  For OSX ownload the zip here 

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uStceYZ25zGLt6KTwCcE6YIUqzXRrYk6

unzip and follow the instructions in the txt file named "(()))00ReadThisTextFile!" and have fun!

for windows download the zip here

and then follow the instructions here for installing visual studio 2017 https://openframeworks.cc/setup/vs/ and then follow the instructions in the txt file named "(()))00ReadThisTextFile!" and have fun!  *edit ok i forgot to add that into the windows version* heres the text for now


"WHAT THE HECK IS THIS????

Welp you have downloaded and uncompressed the video_waaaves_2 ! please note that before going any further you should make sure to have visual studio 2017 installed according to the instructions linked in the readme!
once you have achieved vs2017 steps then all you have to do is go to apps->myapps and then open up VIDEO_WAAAVES_IM_windows  folder and find the thing that says VIDEO_WAAAVES_IM_windows.vcxproj, double click on that.  The virtual studio console will pop up and you will see a button with the play symbol on it somewhere around the middle top of the screen, press that button and have fun!"
*end edit*

The most notable thing about the 2.0 update is that i fixed all the stuff that i broke when i put midi controls in, new controls for the sharpening algorithm that allow for a lot more complex reaction diffusion patterns, and fucking like a million lfos everywhere.  For everyone who downloaded the 2.0 upon release i have since fixed the thing where channel 2 wasn't getting mixed in as well

requires ofxSyphon https://github.com/astellato/ofxSyphon, 
ofxMidi https://github.com/danomatika/ofxMidi, 
and ofxImGui https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui

for windows and linux check the noSyphon folder for alternate versions of some files to copy over into the src folder to get u up and running in syphon free zones

if you have never used oF and/or Xcode before here are some troubleshooting tips to try
1. the entire folder structure needs to be intact and moved into the apps/myApps folder within the openframeworks folder
2. try running project generator and importing this folder (with the abovementioned addons) if theres still errors
3. https://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/ has some advice on how to troubleshoot troublesome addons as well so check this out too!

numereous secret keyboard commands
to scale syphon input press[] and ;/

to rotate and shift framebuffer xyz positions a,z,s,x,d,c,f,v,g,b,h,n,t,y can all be used, the numerical key '3' resets all positions

the numerical key '1'clears the framebuffer

(yes i know that is far from all of the parameters.  I'll be frank, adding full midi support for every parameter would be pretty boring and time consuming and adds very little to my personal usage of this software!  if you want more midi ccs mapped to parameters you'll basically have to pay me because its pretty unlikely that i'll decide one afternoon "hmmm what i could i do that is boring and time consuming and gives me no personal satisfaction.  a paypal button can be found at andreijaycreativecoding.com)
